# DailyForge

A manual-logging fitness and habit tracker where every logged action becomes points, and points are the single currency across the whole app. Workouts, runs, habits, activities and goals all feed one score, and that score is spendable on rewards you define yourself.

- **Specification:** [docs/DAILYFORGE_SPEC.md](docs/DAILYFORGE_SPEC.md) — the source of truth.
- **Product record:** [PRODUCT.md](PRODUCT.md) — users, purpose, invariants, confirmed decisions.
- **Operating manual:** [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) — the short version, read at the start of every session.
- **Deployment:** [docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) — four phases, deployable from phase 1.

## Status

**M0 — Foundations. Complete.**

Monorepo, both scaffolds, the Flyway baseline for the points ledger, the design token system with theme and motion switching, fifteen UI primitives, and the gallery that proves them. Nothing talks to a server yet; M1 brings identity.

Milestones M1–M9 are listed in spec §11.

## Requirements

- **JDK 21.** A newer JDK is fine — Gradle resolves a 21 toolchain automatically on first build.
- **Node 22+** and npm 10+.
- Docker, only if you want to rehearse a migration against real PostgreSQL.

## Running it

Two terminals.

```bash
# backend — http://localhost:8080
cd backend
./gradlew bootRun --args='--spring.profiles.active=local'

# frontend — http://localhost:4200
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

The frontend proxies `/api` to the backend, so there is no CORS in development and no hostname is hardcoded anywhere.

Open **http://localhost:4200/dev/ui** for the design gallery: every primitive, every state, with theme, motion and width switches in the bar at the top.

### The database

Local development uses **file-mode H2** at `backend/.data/dailyforge`, not in-memory. That is deliberate: you cannot test a seven-day streak against a database that forgets on restart. Delete the `.data` directory to start clean.

Tests use in-memory H2, fresh per run. Production uses PostgreSQL 16. The same Flyway migrations run on all three, which is why they avoid `citext`, native enums, `jsonb` and partial indexes — see the note at the top of `V1__baseline.sql`.

The H2 console is at http://localhost:8080/h2-console on the `local` profile (JDBC URL `jdbc:h2:file:./.data/dailyforge`, user `sa`, no password).

## Tests

```bash
cd backend && ./gradlew check     # unit + slice tests, plus coverage verification
cd frontend && npm run test:ci    # vitest
```

Both run in CI on every push and pull request.

## The rules that are not negotiable

These are the ones that cause subtle, expensive bugs when broken. Full detail in spec §4–§5.

1. Points are awarded only by `PointsService`. Nothing else writes to `points_entry`.
2. The ledger is append-only. Undo writes a compensating entry; it never deletes or edits one.
3. Score is `SUM(amount)`. The cache must be exactly rebuildable from the ledger.
4. The frontend never calculates points — it renders what the API returned.
5. All day logic goes through `DayService`. No `LocalDate.now()` elsewhere, no `new Date()` for logical dates in the frontend.
6. No magic numbers. Every point value comes from `points_rule_config`.
7. Every write endpoint is idempotent via `Idempotency-Key`.
8. Every query is scoped by `user_id` at the repository layer.
9. Schema changes go through Flyway. `ddl-auto=validate`, always.
10. Editing the past triggers reconciliation in the same transaction.

## Design

**Cold steel, earned heat.** The interface is a quiet workshop — cool greys, precise rules, tabular numerals. Warm colour appears only where you have earned something. An untouched day is grey; a logged day glows; a personal record is the hottest thing on screen.

The rule is enforced by the token system rather than by memory: heat tokens are earned-value tokens, and a component that is not showing an earned quantity has none to reach for. There is deliberately no warm "primary" or "brand" colour available.

Design tokens are CSS custom properties in `frontend/src/styles/tokens.css`. Never hardcode a colour in a component.
